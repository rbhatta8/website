    "# Premise\n",
    "\n",
    "As all of you are well aware, a prominent member of the Dota 2 community, SirActionSlacks recently posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOqCyGd7lRs) declaring his long-standing hatred for Windranger and making some serious accusations about the viability of the hero. 1 minute and 7 seconds into the video SirActionSlacks evokes what is essentially the Bat signal for causal inference researchers. He quite correctly states that **correlation is not causation** and muses, well, can we really tell if Windranger **causes** us to lose in our pubs, and pros to lose at TI. He then proceeds to provide anecdotal evidence that Windranger truly is a cause for losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I wondered for a while about how I could gather the correct kind of data given that most games are spread over several patches and performing a sound causal analysis of ever-shifting distributions can be quite tricky. To my delight, soon after SirActionSlacks' video, another prominent member of the community, Wagamama, promised to play 100 games of Windranger first pick (unless banned). His games over this period turned out to be just what I was looking for!\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Question\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize the causal question: one way to get at what SirActionSlacks is asking is -- what is the probability of winning had I forced (intervened) on everyone to pick Windranger vs. had I forced everyone to pick some other hero. Or if you're familiar with do-calculus what is the **Average Causal Effect (ACE)** of Windranger on winning the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ACE = E[Win\\mid do(Windranger=1)] - E[Win\\mid do(Windranger=0)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the outcome of interest is a binary variable, as is the case in the present analysis (did you win or not), the causal effect is often reported as an **odds ratio**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Causal odds} = \\frac{p(Win=1\\mid do(Windranger=1)/p(Win=0\\mid do(Windranger=1)}{p(Win=1\\mid do(Windranger=0)/p(Win=0\\mid do(Windranger=0)}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in this analysis, I consider Windranger to be the **\"treatment\"** of interest and winning to be the **\"outcome\"** (a lot of causal theory comes from epidemiology and economics, hence the terms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I compiled the data from the Dotabuff for Wagamama's smurf [ZÃ¡topek](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/123048453) since he began this challenge (123 games total). For each game, I collected data on the following variables that I thought might be key in the analysis:\n",
    "* **MatchID** - unique identifier for the match.\n",
    "* **NotBanned** - was Windranger not banned (0 or 1).\n",
    "* **Windranger** - Did Waga pick Windranger (0 or 1).\n",
    "* **GPM** - Waga's gold per minute.\n",
    "* **XPM** - Waga's experience per minute.\n",
    "* **Blademail** - Did the enemy team buy one or more blademails (0 or 1).\n",
    "* **GhostEblade** - Did the enemy team buy one or more ghost sceptres/eblades/have a hero capable of ethereal form (0 or 1).\n",
    "* **HeroCounter** - Was there a counter to Waga's hero on the enemy team (0 or 1). Top 5 counters listed on Dotabuff at the time were considered. These were -- Tinker, Centaur, Shadow Demon, Ember Spirit, Mars for Windranger. If Waga played a different hero, the corresponding top 5 counters for the hero were used.\n",
    "* **KillingItem** - Did enemies buy an item explicitly to kill Waga's hero (0 or 1). For Windranger I considered this to be items that grant true strike e.g. MKB, Divine Rapier, Bloodthorn as well as burst like Dagon + Veil. For a hero like Weaver, I considered this to be items like Orchid/Bloodthorn and Hex.\n",
    "* **Damage** - Amount of damage output by Waga.\n",
    "* **Win** - Did Waga win (0 or 1).\n",
    "* **Notes** - Some notes I took while curating the data."

This can happen only if we are willing to believe that any factors that cause Waga to pick Windranger do not also affect his chances of winning the game. That is, Waga's tendency to pick Windranger is **perfectly randomized** and there are no unmeasured confounders. Since I primarily do causal inference with graphs, let's look at what the graph of a **randomized controlled trial** looks like where the \"treatment\" is whether Waga picks Windranger or not, and the outcome is if he wins or not."

As SirActionSlacks mentions in his video, we can never truly know the underlying psyche that caused Waga to not pick Windranger despite it not being banned. Further, this same underlying mental state may also cause Waga to win or lose his games. However, it is certainly the case that whether Windranger is banned or not is a strong predictor of whether Waga will pick the hero. Further, the ban status of the hero is not a direct cause of Waga losing or winning his games, it only affects the outcome through the actual picking of the hero. It also seems plausible to assume that whether or not people choose to ban Windranger does not share any common causes with the final outcome. Thus, the ban status of the hero is a perfect candidate for an **instrumental variable** for our causal analysis. Informally speaking, an instrumental variable satisfies three conditions.\n",

    "So what can we conclude from the above analyses? Using principled strategies for causal inference such as instrumental variable analysis and front-door analysis can yield interesting insights into the universe of Dota 2. The fact that the instrumental variable and front-door methods both point to the causal effect of picking Windranger on winning to be (roughly) null, I view this as a sign that Windranger is a well balanced hero (which is a testament to the attention to detail by the developers of the game). On average, if you force (intervene on) yourself to pick Windranger every game, you are no more likely to lose than you are to win. I conjecture, that if I were to run a similar analysis on a currently \"broken\" hero such as Ember Spirit or \"high-risk\" hero such as Meepo the findings would be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course 123 games is a small sample size, and I have only analyzed the games of a single (and highly skilled) player. These findings may not **transport** to other skill brackets and may also change given more data. But I am excited about the possibilities for more causal analysis of this kind in the world of Dota 2! The present analysis, however, unfortunately does not support SirActionSlacks' claim of Windranger being a terrible hero!"
